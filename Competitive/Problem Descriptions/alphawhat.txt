The Muddled Alphabetizer
------------------------

Professor McBits wants you to print out subsets of the
alphabet in alphabetical order.  The only problem is
he has a muddled idea of what alphabetical order is.
But he is the Professor, so you must do what he wants.

For example, the Professor may believe that

	d<b	d<a	b<a	b<c	c<a

which means the letter a, b, c, d have the order

	d b c a

Input
-----

Several test cases, each consisting of a list of
instructions.  Each instruction has the form X<Y, where
X and Y are lower case letters, except for the last
instruction, which is just `*' to signal the end of
input for the test case.  The instructions may be
spread across several lines and with any spacing, but
each instruction but the last has exactly 3 characters,
the middle one of which is always `<', and the others
of which are always LOWER CASE letters.

The input ends with an end of file.

Output
------

One line per test case containing the letters mentioned
in the test case instructions in the order specified by
these instructions.  The letters must be separated by
a single space character.  There most be no other space
characters in the output line.
