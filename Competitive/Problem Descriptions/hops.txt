Fewest Hops Between Network Nodes
------ ---- ------- ------- -----

You have been hired by a network operator to compute the
length of the shortest path between each pair of nodes
in a network.

The N nodes in a network are numbered from 0 through
N-1.  N can be at most 20.

A direct connection between two nodes is called a `hop',
and is bidirectional.  The length of a path in the
network is measured in hops, and is equal to one less
than the number of nodes in the path.  E.g. the path

	1 -- 3 -- 2 -- 5

from node 1 to node 5 has 3 hops and 4 nodes.

The distance between two nodes is the length of the
shortest path between them.  The distance between two
nodes that CANNOT connect to each other is infinity.
The distance between a node and itself is defined to be
0.

The input consists of input for any number of networks.
The input for a network consists of the number of nodes
in the network, N, a list of bidirectional direct
connections, and a pair of -1's.  Each bidirectional
direct connection is represented by the numbers of the
nodes at its ends, that is, by a pair of numbers.  All
the numbers are integers separated by whitespace, where
whitespace is any combination of spaces ( ' ' ) and
newlines.  The input ends with an end of file.

The output consists of a line with the format

NETWORK #

followed by a matrix in N lines.  The # above denotes
the number of the input network: input networks are
numbered 1, 2, 3, ... .

The output matrix is such that the element in the i'th
row and j'th column is the distance between node i and
node j.  Here the rows are labeled 0, 1, ...  from top
to bottom, and the columns 0, 1, ... from left to right.
Each matrix element should take exactly 4 print columns,
and contain either a number of hops, as a right adjusted
integer, or a `-' right adjusted if the distance is
infinity.  You should NOT print row and column labels.
Thus the matrix output consists of N lines each with 4N
characters.
