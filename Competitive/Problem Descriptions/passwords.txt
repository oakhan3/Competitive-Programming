Password Pat
-------- ---

Password Pat is known for making slick passwords such
as
		@hwl2rt&tk

which is derived from the sentence

  At Hogwarts we love to roast tyrants and tea kettles.

by applying the following rules while reading the
sentence:

(1) On reading a non-special word, output its first
    letter in lower case.

    Here and in (2) a word is any sequence of upper or
    lower case letters surrounded by non-letters.

(2) The special words and the single character to
    output are:

	and	&		zero	0
	or	|		one	1
	not	!		two	2
	equal	=		three	3
	plus	+		four	4
	minus	-		five	5
	times	*		six	6
	slash	/		seven	7
	dollar	$		eight	8
	percent	%		nine	9
	at	@		to	2
				for	4
				ate	8

    Note these words are recognized even if some of
    their letters are capitals.

(3) On reading space characters, output nothing.

(4) On reading punctuation, output the punctuation,
    except on reading a period output nothing.  Punctua-
    tion is any character that is not a letter or space
    character.

(5) Numbers are not permitted in the sentence (unless
    spelled out as words).  Quotes and apostrophes are
    not permitted.

Pat does not limit herself to a single input sentence.
For example, the input

	fairly!		squarely!	I won?

produces the password:		f!s!iw?

You are to write a program that will apply Pat's rules
to sentences to derive a password.

Input
-----

Lines each of which contains one or more sentences.
Words on the line are sequences of consecutive letters.
All input characters are letters, spaces, or one of the
punctuation characters .!?, .  No line is longer than
80 characters.  Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

One line containing a password for each input line.  The
password on a line must be that derived by applying
Pat's rules to the sentences in the corresponding input
line.  There are no spaces or tabs in any output line.
